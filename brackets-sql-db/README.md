# brackets-sql-db

This is a partial implementation of the [`CrudInterface`](https://drarig29.github.io/brackets-docs/reference/manager/interfaces/CrudInterface.html) to use a SQL database.

Help is welcome if you made something which works in your own project! ðŸ˜Š

The rest of the files is missing because it was in a private project with no ORM so we created a bunch of classes manually...
To keep things simple, it would be a good idea to use an ORM instead, like [typeorm](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) for example.
